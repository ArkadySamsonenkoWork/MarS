            list of tuples, where each tuple contains two base operator tensors

            The coupling Hamiltonian is constructed as a sum over channels k:

            is multiplied by the external field

            If a specific term is not necessary for the system, the corresponding tensor
            should be None. These tensors are constructed from fundamental operators
            (e.g., spin components Sx, Sy, Sz) and should be defined in the same basis

            O_dependent must be 1 / Tesla.
