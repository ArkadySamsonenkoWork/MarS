    """COmputes the population-dependent part of the transition intensity for
    stationary (CW) EPR spectra.

    The population difference between upper and lower resonant levels determines the net absorption
    (or emission) intensity. Two initialization strategies are supported:

    1. **Thermal equilibrium**: Populations follow the Boltzmann distribution at `init_temperature`:
        p_i ∝ exp(−E_i / k_B T),
       and the population difference for a transition i ← j is:
        Δp = p_j − p_i.
       This is used when no Context is provided, or when the Context does not define initial populations.

    2. **Context-defined populations**: If the Context specifies initial populations (e.g., photoexcited
       triplet sublevel polarization), these are used instead of thermal values. The populations are
       automatically transformed into the field-dependent eigenbasis using `full_system_vectors`.

    Extended version of `StationaryPopulator` that supports multiple independent
    temperature values and/or additional batch dimensions.

    In the base `StationaryPopulator`, the `init_temperature` is a scalar used
    for all energy levels across all samples. In this expanded version,
    `init_temperature` can have its own batch dimensions (e.g., multiple temperature
    points per structure). These are broadcasted correctly against the energy tensor.

    **Key differences**:
    - `_temp_dependant_init_population` reshapes `self.init_temperature` to have a
      leading batch dimension followed by ones to align with the energy tensor
      dimensions, using `reshape`. This allows
      temperature to vary across different independent configurations (e.g., different
      sample points or different mean iterations).

    The temperature should have dimensions: [temp_dimension, *batch_dimensions]
    The output has shape: [temp_dimension, *bathc_dimensions, spin_system_dimensions]
