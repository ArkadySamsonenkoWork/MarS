Spectra Creators
================

The ``spectra_creators`` module provides a unified interface for simulating various types of Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra using the MarS library. These creators encapsulate the full computational pipeline—from Hamiltonian diagonalization and transition intensity calculation to orientation averaging, line broadening, and spectral integration—while supporting both stationary (continuous-wave) and time-resolved experiments.

All spectra creators inherit from the abstract base class :class:`mars.spectra_manager.BaseSpectra`, which defines the core architecture and parameter handling. The specific implementations differ primarily in how they treat spin dynamics: either through population kinetics, density-matrix evolution under the Lindblad master equation, or field/frequency domain assumptions.

This section documents the main spectra creator classes available in MarS:
