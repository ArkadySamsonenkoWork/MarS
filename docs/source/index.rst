Welcome to MarS!
=================
**MarS** is a Python library for simulating Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra, optimizing spin Hamiltonian and kinetic parameters against experimental data,
and computing both continuous-wave (CW) and time-resolved EPR signals. Built on PyTorch, it supports efficient batched computations on CPU and GPU with flexible numerical precision.

Key features include:

- Construction of multi-spin systems with electrons and nuclei
- Comprehensive interaction models (Zeeman, ZFS, hyperfine, exchange, dipolar)
- Powder and single-crystal sample simulations with orientation averaging
- Population kinetics and full density matrix relaxation formalisms
- Flexible relaxation parameters management for complex experimental scenarios
- Automated parameter optimization via Optuna and Nevergrad
- Time-resolved EPR modeling with multiple relaxation paradigms
