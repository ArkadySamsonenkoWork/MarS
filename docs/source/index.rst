Welcome to MarS!
=================
MarS is a Python library for simulating Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra, optimizing spin Hamiltonian and kinetic parameters to match experimental data,
and computing both continuous-wave (CW) and time-resolved EPR signals.
It provides robust tools for spectral simulation, automated parameter search, and modeling of transient spin dynamics under relaxation mechanisms.
